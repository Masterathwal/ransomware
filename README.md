# üîê Python Ransomware Project (Fernet-based)

This project demonstrates how to build a basic file encryption and decryption tool using the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` module in Python. **The script encrypts all files in the current directory**, excluding any **folders/subdirectories**, and includes a `decrypt.py` script to revert the files back to their original state.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes**.

- Do **not** use this script on real, sensitive, or production files.
- Only run and test this script in a **controlled environment** (such as a virtual machine or a disposable test folder).
- **Never distribute** or use this tool for malicious purposes. Unauthorized file encryption or data manipulation may be **illegal** and could result in **criminal charges**.
- The authors and contributors take **no responsibility** for misuse or data loss.

Always understand what your code is doing
